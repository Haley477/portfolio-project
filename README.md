This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
This project was made in Web Development class to practice using Next.js by creating a fake website that can be used as a portfolio eventually for all of the projects and jobs and languages that have been learned. 
It uses a lot of the main features that Next.js contains that other web developing tools don't. It was actually made mainly from the help of AI. In this project, our teacher encouraged us to use AI as much as we can.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
